## Introduction

If you're on a Windows workstation and want to use Bazel, the best option I've found is using Windows Subsystem for Linux or WSL.

The benefit of using WSL is the awesome native integration with Visual Studio Code. You can launch your project in WSL and simply use the VS Code you've already installed. As a developer, I've been using these features for years and sincerely appreciate Microsoft embracing WSL as an alternative development environment.

### Installation

Follow the directions found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

### Using VSCode with WSL

Learning how to use VSCode with WSL can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2019/09/03/wsl2)
