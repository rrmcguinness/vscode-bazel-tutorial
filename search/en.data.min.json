Request access if the repository is private. Fork the repository. This makes a copy to your local GitHub account. Clone the newly created fork to your developer machine. git clone \u0026lt;repository name\u0026gt; Make any changes or additions to the code. Write automated test cases. Verify all tests are passing and all code is commented and meets the style guide requirements. _ bazel test //... runs all tests _ bazel coverage //java/... runs test coverage on a specific target. Commit your code, and push back to your fork. git commit add . git commit -a Add comments, if you are referencing a feature or bug, please indicate the number first. git push Verify the build runs in GitHub actions on your own branch. This is important, especially if you are updating BUILD or WORKSPACE files. From the GitHub interface, create a pull request and ensure you comment the reasons and thought processes behind the change or additions. * Understanding Pull Requests Once created, you will collaborate with the mantainers for QA purposes, unless they simply accept the changed and merge it. If not, you may be asked to make some changes and create a new PR. Licensing All content on this site is licened under the Apache 2.0 license. Please see the LICENSE file in the source code.

Because writing a turorial to create a \u0026lsquo;/data/projects\u0026rsquo; directory on MacOS seems to be a hit-and-miss since / is a read-only mount, and /etc/synthetic.conf has other issues.\nSteps # Create a projects directory, this example creates it on the /opt file system # This IS NOT recommended, but is done so for the sake of a conistant development environment. # Please feel free to put this any path you have access, but you need to remember for a couple of changes. sudo mkdir /opt/projects cd /opt/projects # Clone the repository git clone https://github.com/rrmcguinness/vscode-bazel-tutorial # Run Bazel once before starting bazel build //... # Open Visual Studio Code # If you changed the download location: code . # If you didn\u0026#39;t change the download location: code vscode-bazel-tutorial.code-workspace Edit the workspace (IF YOU CHANGED THE DOWNLOAD LOCATION) Once Visual Studio Code has opened, edit the vscode-bazel-tutorial.code-workspace file.\nChange all occurances of \u0026ldquo;/opt/projects\u0026rdquo; to your download directoy.

There are two example implementations, one in Go, the other in Java. The functionality is stubbed out, but shows how to build a multiple language project using Bazel. Lastly, it ties it all together with a predefined workspace and task to make it repeatable.\nArchitecture Overivew (Ryan McGuinness) What this IS NOT This repository IS NOT a general purpose tutorial for how to use Bazel, Visual Studio Code, Java, or Go.
